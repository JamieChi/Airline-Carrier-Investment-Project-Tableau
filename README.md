# Airline-Carrier-Investment-Project-Tableau
This dataset, covering the top 1,000 US city-pair markets (fares, distance, share), informs an investor's view. We pinpoint airlines with future potential by identifying carriers that can manage rising costs, exploit pricing power, and grow on competitive, underserved routes to capture upside from the resurgence in US air travel.
